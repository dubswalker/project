# Project Proposal
Create a Compiler with GO-Language

This project is more on the lines of using what I learned in class to create another compiler with golang. 2 weeks is a short amount of time to create an entire compiler so for this project the goal is to atleast have a Lexer/Parser and AST Generator.
